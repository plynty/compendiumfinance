**Managing** your money can be stressful. And confusing and complicated advice from the financial services industry just makes it harder. But as the authors of this clear, practical, and enlightening book – part financial guide, part exposé – prove, there are just three simple rules you need to follow and only a few investment products that are necessary for an ideal portfolio. That’s it. And the authors dispense with all that “expert” advice by deftly debunking what they call investing’s Seven Deadly Temptations.  By embracing commonsense solutions and rejecting investments that seem enticing but are needlessly complex, overpriced, and risky, you’ll put not only yourself in a stronger position but the entire economy as well.
